# Smart Cart System

In this project we create a Cart System for a mall so that user can get the bill automatically.

In this first we create 3 lists as:- 

**1-> Categories** --> It contains the categories of items.

**2->Items** --> It conatins the names of the items of the mall.

**3-->Price**  --> It conatins prices of the items which are in the mall

Then we show the chart of the items to the user as it contains --> categories, items name ,items price with index no. of items

Then we take the input of user as it will input the index no. of the particular item.

when user will want to exit it will press 10 for exit

Then we show the output of the cart with the details of items user purchased with bill. 

Bill is saved in the file also named as Total.txt for the Mall record purpose.
