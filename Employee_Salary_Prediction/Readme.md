# Employee Salary Prediction

### In this project we take the data of Salary of people & then we visulaize this data & after that we apply Machine Learning to this data to predict the salary of the person.

### We apply some steps into this project:->

### 1-> Load the data of Salary.

### 2-> Make data frame of the required features.

### 3-> Now Visualize this data to find which alog is suitable for this.

### 4-> By Visulaization we can see that the data is a classification type data.

### 5-> Then we create the model classifier.

### 6-> Fit the data to the model.

### 7-> Now predict by the model.
