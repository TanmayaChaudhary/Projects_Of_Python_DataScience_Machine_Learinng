# Live Face Detection

### In this project first we satrt the camera of the system then pass it to the program & take frames one by one from  the camera & then convert this frame to the grayscale image fotmat.

### Then we build a detector which detects the faces using a **front_haar_cascade**

### Now we take face one by one & get there coordinates or the face & make a rectangle on the faces.

### Finally we draw a rectangle of red colour on the Live Cam Screen.
