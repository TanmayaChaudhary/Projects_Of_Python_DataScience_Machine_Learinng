# Face Detection In An Image

### In this project first we take an image & convert it to the grayscale image fotmat.

### Then we build a detector which detects the faces using a **front_haar_cascade**

### Now we take face one by one & get there coordinates or the face & make a rectangle on the faces.

### Finally we show the image in which the faces are in rectangle of red colour.
